type: print-list

# List the HTML files to be included in output PDFs here.
# You can use Liquid control-flow tags to include or exclude files.
# E.g. here we only include the cover when output in _config is `pdf-ebook`.
# Then use this list with the PrinceXML command line, e.g. from the book's folder in _site:
# prince -l print-list -o book.pdf
# You can exclude files from your print-list temporarily by surrounding them with
# Liquid comment tags: {% comment %}{% endcomment %}

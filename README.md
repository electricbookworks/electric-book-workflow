# A Guide to the Electric Book workflow

This repo hosts the guide to making digital-first books in print, as ebooks, and for the web, starting with the [Electric Book Jekyll template](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book).

Like this guide, the workflow is a work in progress. Used well, it can completely replace InDesign for the production of high-quality book interiors that are largely text with some images, such as novels, non-fiction books, essays, papers, poetry, textbooks, manuals and reports.

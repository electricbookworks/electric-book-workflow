  description: |
    The Electric Book workflow is a set of tools and processes for creating high-quality books. We developed it at <a href="http://electricbookworks.com">Electric Book Works</a> for our own publishing. It lets you store books in plain text with great version control, and output website versions, ebooks and print editions easily from a single source. At the heart of the workflow is the <a href="https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book">Electric Book Jekyll template</a>. With some technical expertise, you can use it, too.
